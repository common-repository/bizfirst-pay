= How can I sign up? =
To sign up for an account, go to [https://app.bizfirst.xyz/](https://app.bizfirst.xyz/)

= How can I sell something once I have signed up for an account? =
There are two ways of selling with BizFirst:
‍

d. Send the invoice to the recipient directly via BizFirst. You can also copy the invoice link and share it over text.

= Which cryptocurrencies can I accept? =
We only support USDC on Solana. The reasons are as follows:
‍
1. **USDC for Volatility:** Payments are best done in low-zero volatility assets to avoid losses i.e. a T-shirt sold for $10 worth of crypto should not turn to $5 worth of crypto when redeeming for USD. [USDC is the most trusted stable-coin](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) with the price pegged to the dollar i.e. Each USDC is worth $1.00 and is always redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars via Centralised Exchanges such as Coinbase and FTX.
‍
2. **Solana for Cost and Speed: Solana is one of the fastest blockchains with one of the lowest costs, which makes it ideal for users to use in payments.**

= What is a seed phrase and why do I need it? =
BizFirst creates a semi-custodial wallet for your safety where you also get access to your Seed Phrase.  A seed phrase is a sequence of 12 words that gives you,  access to the cryptocurrency that you have received. This can be imported to any Solana Wallet to access your USDC.
